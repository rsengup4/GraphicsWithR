  abstract = { A total of 401 eligible patients with resected stages B and C colorectal carcinoma were randomly assigned to no-further therapy or to adjuvant treatment with either levamisole alone, 150 mg/d for 3 days every 2 weeks for 1 year, or levamisole plus fluorouracil (5-FU), 450 mg/m2/d intravenously (IV) for 5 days and beginning at 28 days, 450 mg/m2 weekly for 1 year. Levamisole plus 5-FU, and to a lesser extent levamisole alone, reduced cancer recurrence in comparison with no adjuvant therapy. These differences, after correction for imbalances in prognostic variables, were only suggestive for levamisole alone (P = .05) but quite significant for levamisole plus 5-FU (P = .003). Whereas both treatment regimens were associated with overall improvements in survival, these improvements reached borderline significance only for stage C patients treated with levamisole plus 5-FU (P = .03). Therapy was clinically tolerable with either regimen and severe toxicity was uncommon. These promising results have led to a large national intergroup confirmatory trial currently in progress. },

  abstract = {Abstract Multivariate failure time data are commonly encountered in scientific investigations because each study subject may experience multiple events or because there exists clustering of subjects such that failure times within the same cluster are correlated. In this paper, I present a general methodology for analysing such data, which is analogous to that of Liang and Zeger for longitudinal data analysis. This approach formulates the marginal distributions of multivariate failure times with the familiar Cox proportional hazards models while leaving the nature of dependence among related failure times completely unspecified. The baseline hazard functions for the marginal models may be identical or different. Simple estimating equations for the regression parameters are developed which yield consistent and asymptotically normal estimators, and robust variance-covarinace estimators are constructed to account for the intra-class correlation. Simulation results demonstrate that the large-sample approximations are adequate for practical use and that ignoring the intra-class correlation could yield rather misleading variance estimators. The proposed methodology has been fully implemented in a simple computer program which also incorporates several alternative approaches. Detailed illustrations with data from four clinical or epidemiologic studies are provided.},

  abstract = { Objective: To determine the effectiveness of two adjuvant therapy regimens in improving surgical cure rates in stage III (Dukes stage C) colon cancer. Design: Randomized, concurrently controlled clinical trial. Setting: Major cancer centers, universities, and community clinics affiliated with the North Cancer Treatment Group, the Southwest Oncology Group, and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. Patients: Those who had had curative-intent resections of stage III colon cancer in the previous 1 to 5 weeks. Intervention: Patients were assigned to observation only, to levamisole alone (50 mg orally three times/d for 3 days, repeated every 2 weeks for 1 year), or to this regimen of levamisole plus fluorouracil (450 mg/m2 body surface area intravenously daily for 5 days and then, beginning at 28 days, weekly for 48 weeks). Measurements: Rates of cancer recurrence and death. Early-and late-treatment side effects. Results: With all 929 eligible patients able to be followed for 5 years or more (median follow-up, 6.5 years), fluorouracil plus levamisole reduced the recurrence rate by 40\% (P < 0.0001) and the death rate by 33\% (P = 0.0007). Levamisole reduced the recurrence rate by only 2\% and the death rate by only 6\%. With few exceptions, toxicity was mild and patient compliance was excellent. No evidence of late side effects was seen. Conclusion: Fluorouracil plus levamisole is tolerable adjuvant therapy to surgery; it has been confirmed to substantially increase cure rates for patients with high-risk (stage III) colon cancer. It should be considered standard treatment for all such patients not entered into clinical trials. },
